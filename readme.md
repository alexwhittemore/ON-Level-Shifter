The ON Level Shifter is a two channel, unidirectional level shifter targeted at UART serial connections. It is implemented using two ON Semi MC74VHC1GT126 devices. These buffer a TTL input (Vil <.8V, Vih >2V) to a CMOS output (Voh > .8VCC, Vol < .1VCC). They are tolerant of up to 7V input regardless of VCC, and function with VCC as low as 3V, making them ideal for interfacing 2.5 or 3.3V logic on the low side with 3.3 or 5V logic on the high side.
